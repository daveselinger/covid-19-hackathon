        "\n",
        "The purpose of this analysis is to help people understand the severity of the COVID19 in a more realistic fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "We, the authors, believe that the analysis of COVID19 using national data is lacking in precision and actionability. Further, we feel that it may not be really representative of the \"on-the-ground\" experience: i.e., you can't average the experience of rural Montana with that of metropolitan Manhattan; or in fact even compare the metropolitan area of Seattle with that in San Diego.\n",

        "\n",
        "This code, its methodology, and conclusions are all released without any additional warranties or expectations using the MIT Open Source License.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Social implications and responsibility**\n",
        "\n",
        "While we are statisticians we recognize that there may be conclusions drawn from this analysis that have political and or personal ramifications for people. We therefore release this information to the open source with the best of intentions and with the hopes that these conclusions are used to save lives in a period of intense anxiety and volatility. In a world when it is hard to know \"which facts\" to believe, we have done everything we can to remove bias, to be explicit and transparent in the assumptions made and to be clear of our intent: We believe that more data will be better; we are disappointed in the lack of testing data -- and that is clear from our conclusions (these conslusions must be caveated with the fact that our model is affected by the variance because of the CDC's inability to test at the scale needed to face this problem); we believe that even with this volatility of data in a time of such dire consequences as has been proven in Wuhan China and Northern Italy, to not reach the best possible conclusions based on the data that we do have would be a dereliction of our duty and an act of ignorance. Therefore we submit this analysis and conclusions with nothing less than the best hopes for our citizens and with the desire for our local and state governments to do what is necessary regardless of any resistance they may face: We implore state health departments to act faster--even faster than the CDC and FDA might desire.\n"

The most likely places for broadly spreading COVID are in places where many people are interacting frequently (i.e., metropolitan areas). Therefore, we have made the assumption that the case-incident data would reflect this distribution of cases. We chose 90% as an assumption based on the virulence and high R0 of this disease--the higher this value, the more exaggerated the impact of even a very few cases in a dense metro area. Furthermore, we estimate that only 40% of the population of a state lives in this based on an approximation from the WAPO combining \"Metropolitan\" and \"Big City\"\n",
